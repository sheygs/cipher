### Lesson 55

Currently, your code raises a `TypeError`, because the `caesar` function is defined with two parameters (`message` and `offset`), therefore it expects to be called with two arguments.

Calling `caesar()` without the required arguments stops the execution of the code.

Give `message` and `offset` values, by passing `text` and `shift` as arguments to the `caesar` function call.
