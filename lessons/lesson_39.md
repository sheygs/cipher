### Lesson 39

You can obtain the same effect of `a = a + b` by using the addition assignment operator:

```python
a += b
```

The addition assignment operator enables you to add a value to a variable and then assign the result to that variable.

Use the `+=` operator to add a value and assign it at the same time to `encrypted_text`.
