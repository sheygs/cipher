### Lesson 17

`.find()` returns the index of the matching character inside the string. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`. As you can see, the first character in `text`, uppercase `'H'`, is not found, since `alphabet` contains only lowercase letters.

You can transform a string into its lowercase equivalent with the `.lower()` method. Add another `print()` call to print `text.lower()` and see the output.
