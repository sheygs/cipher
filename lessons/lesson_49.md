A function is essentially a reusable block of code. You have already met some built-in functions, like `print()`, `find()` and `len()`. But you can also define custom functions like this:

Example Code

```python
def function_name():
    <code>
```

A function declaration starts with the `def` keyword followed by the function name — a valid variable name — and a pair of parentheses. The declaration ends with a colon.

Right after your `shift` variable, declare a function called `caesar` and indent all the following lines to give your new function a body.
