The pass keyword can be used as a placeholder for future code. It does not have any effect in your code but it can save you from errors you would get in case of incomplete code:

```python
def foo():
  pass
```

Calling vigenere with 1 to encrypt and -1 to decrypt is fine but it might be a little bit cryptic. Create a new function called encrypt that takes message and key parameters, and use pass to fill the function body.
