### Lesson91

In Python, there's a way to easily format strings. f-strings enable you to interpolate values in your strings.

Interpolation means writing placeholders that will be replaced by the specified values when the program runs. For example, you can get the same result of `'Encrypted text: ' + text` with `f'Encrypted text: {text}'`. You need to put an `f` before the quotes to create the f-string and write the variables or expressions you want to interpolate between curly braces.

Modify the first `print()` call to use an f-string.
