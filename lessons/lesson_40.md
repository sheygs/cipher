### Lesson 40

Comparison operators allow you to compare two objects based on their values. You can use a comparison operator by placing it between the objects you want to compare. They return a Boolean value — namely `True` or `False` — depending on the truthfulness of the expression.

Python has the following comparison operators:

Operator Meaning
`==` Equal
`!=` Not equal
`>` Greater than
`<` Less than
`>=` Greater than or equal to
`<=` Less than or equal to

At the beginning of your loop body, print the result of comparing `char` with a space (`' '`). Use the equality operator `==` for that.
