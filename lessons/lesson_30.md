### Lesson 30

Strings are immutable, which means they cannot be changed once created. For example, you might think that the following code changes the value of `my_string` into the string `'train'`, but this is not valid:

```python
my_string = 'brain'
my_string[0] = 't'
```

Confirm that by using the bracket notation to access the first letter in `text` and try to change it into a character of your choice. You will see the ouput disappear and an error appear.
