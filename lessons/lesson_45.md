### Lesson 45

When the loop reaches the letter `Z`, the sum `index + shift` exceeds the last index of the string `alphabet`. Therefore, `alphabet[new_index]` is trying to use an invalid index, which causes an `IndexError` to be thrown.

You can notice that the output in the terminal stops at the space immediately before the `Z`, the last `print` before the error is thrown.

In this case, the modulo operator (`%`) can be used to return the remainder of the division between two numbers. For example: `5 % 2` is equal to `1`, because 5 divided by 2 has a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 1.

Surround `index + shift` with parentheses, and modulo the expression with `26`, which is the `alphabet` length.
