### Lesson 21

As you can see from the output, `'h'` is at index `7` in the `alphabet` string. Now you need to find the letter at index `7` plus the value of `shift`. For that, you can use the addition operator, `+`, in the same way you would use it for a mathematical addition.

Modify your `shifted` variable so that it stores the value of `alphabet` at index `index + shift`.
